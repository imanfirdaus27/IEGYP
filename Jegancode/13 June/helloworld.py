# print is a python built in function
# will get help from windows to print the output in the Monitor (output device)
# when you call a function the function name is followed by ()
# in between the open and close brackets we will have n (any) number of arguments
# arguments are seperated using comma
print("Welcome to Python")
# the print function prints all the arguments seperated by space character
print("Jegan", "teaching", "python")


# By default print function has certain behaviour
# After print it will automatically bring you to the next line
# The values are printed with space in between
# however you can modify this behaviour using named argument
# print function has sep, end (named arguments)
print(1, 2, sep=" **** ") # antara 1 and 2 tu ada benda ni
print(10, 11, end=' ') #untuk takyah kebawah guna end=' '
print(12, 13)
