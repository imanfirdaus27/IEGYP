# List is a data structure / sequence
# List is denoted using square bracket []
# List allow duplicates
# List is modifiable
# List is ordered (the items inside the list retain its position)
# List is indexed (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5......)
# Data inside the list is heterogeneous
# the data can be of different types

# Let us create a list
fruits = ["apple", "orange", "mango", "banana", "grapes"]
# fruits is a variable, which can hold more than one value
# fruits is also called an object, which is instance of List (class)
# Jegan, John are objects, instance of Human (class)
# Jegan has 2 eyes, 1 nose (properties) (what he has)
# Jegan can walk, eat, run, teach, listen (methods) (what he can do)
quantity = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
# quantity is a variable, which can hold more than one value
# quantity is also called an object, which is instance of List (class)

# Indexing and Selection
# please refer to variablestwo.py

# You can add more items to the existing list
fruits.append("durian")
print(fruits)

# you can insert items into the existing list
# insert is another method we have in the list class
fruits.insert(1, "rambutan")
print(fruits)
fruits.insert(3, "cempedak")
print(fruits)

# how to modify an existing item
fruits[5] = "mangosteen"
print(fruits)

# how can i remove grapes
# remove is another method we have in the list class
fruits.remove("grapes")
# however this will remove only the first instance of grapes
print(fruits)

# how can i remove an item using index
# there is no method to do this
# however we can use del keyword
# del keyword will delete any thing from memory permanently
del fruits[3]
print(fruits)
# del deletes everything
myname = "Jegan"
del myname
# print(myname)

# Clear all the items in the list
fruits.clear()
print(fruits)
del fruits
# print(fruits)

fruits = ["apple", "orange", "mango", "banana", "orange", "grapes"]
if ("orange" in fruits):
    print(fruits.index("orange"))
    print(fruits[fruits.index("orange")+1:].index("orange") + fruits.index("orange") + 1)

    # fruits[2:] => ["mango", "banana", "orange", "grapes"]
    # fruits[2:].index("orange") => 2........(2)
    # 2 + 1 + 1

# you can also use built in function called enumerate
# enumerate is a function used to find index of every item in the list
enumeratedfruits = enumerate(fruits)
print(enumeratedfruits)
# enumerate object is also an iterable object
# in the for loop => for fruit in fruits
# fruits is a list 
# fruits must be iterable object
# however print function do not know how to iterate it so it prints the
# address location where the object is
# we can typecast any iterable object to a list 
# using a class list
fruitlist = list(enumeratedfruits)
print(fruitlist)
# the enumerated list is a list of tuples
# and each tuple has 2 values 
# 1) index
# 2) fruit (item)

# fruits = ["apple", "orange", "mango"]
# fruits is a variable
# ["apple", "orange", "mango"] is a literal (collection)
# when we assign ["apple", "orange", "mango"] to fruits, fruits becomes an object

# product = "Television"
# product is a variable
# "Television" is a literal
# when we assign "Televison" to product, product becomes an object
# since we assign "Television" (string), product becomes an object/instance of string class

# here we are calling/invoking a class
# we are suppose to create an object by calling the class
# which returns an object fruits

# this parethesis () is really confusing
# we use () in expressions which returns single value (a + b * (c + d) / 100)
# to call/invoke anything in python we use the operator () round bracket
# to call/invoke a function print(), id(), 
# to create an object also range(), list(), tuple(), int(), floot()
# to call/invoke a method "television".split()
# to call/invoke a function inside a module sys.audit()
# to create tuple/datastructrue also we use (10, 20, 30, 40)

# there is one feature which list and tuple has
# auto explode
